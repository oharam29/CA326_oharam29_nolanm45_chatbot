# User Report

When we asked our group of beta testers to test our chatbot service we also asked them to fill out a survey in order to rate the interactions with our service. The following results are generalized and averaged in order to give a broader scope and to protect the anonymity of our testers.

## **How reliable was the service?**

From the responses we received the general  consensus as the that reliability of the service was overall good, we did however get reports back that there were a few outages meaning there may be something on our end that we could look into in the future.

## **Rate the interaction with the chat bot**

The interaction of the chatbot was also noted to be good with the meaning that the bot was able to achieve was it was asked to do. There was also a not that at times the bot being slow to respond to certain queries but over time and as more people query the bot it will learn and be able to respond faster.

## **Was the service easy to use? Why/Why Not?**

All the users said the bot was easy to use as it felt like talking to the bot was like texting a friend, it can recognize slang phrases and direct requests. For example when querying the the train info i can respond to direct request &quot;skerries malahide&quot; or it can respond to &quot;Im looking for trains from skerries to malahide&quot;. The fact it can respond to both forms of speech pattern for lack of a better term, means that however its queried it should be able to recognize the query and respond accordingly.

## **How accurate was the information provided?**

The next piece of data we received back in relation to how accurate the info the bot provided was. Many people felt like we should add in the heading &quot;Due x mins&quot; as that would make it easier to determine when the train was in quickly or when in a rush so we decided that we should implement this.

## **What would you improve about the service?**

Many people suggested we add in the bus service as they didn't know that the API access had been denied but we informed them we would be happy to add this in in the future.

Overall as a group both of us felt that the project was a success and felt that it would be something that we could carry the experience of handling a project forward with us into future projects and even into our work experience on INTRA
